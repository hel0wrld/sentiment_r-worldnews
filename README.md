# sentiment_r-worldnews

### I wanted to perform a sentiment analysis of the top trending articles on r/worldnews. For this purpose, I used PushShift API to scrape Reddit posts, newspaper3k to scrape the body text from the URL attached and SpaCy for Named-Entity-Recognition (NER) on the scraped data to get this dataset. I further performed data cleaning to get rid of errors/advertisements/spam posts and submissions to produce this dataset.

#### If you feel the dataset can be improved further, please reach out to me.
